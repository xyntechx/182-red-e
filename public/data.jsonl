tailor everything to the materials provided.\n\nThe final output should read like a polished, practical study program from a highly effective tutor.", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 1, "view_count": 187, "unique_view_count": 105, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-12-11T18:58:05.938555+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-17T20:08:05.509611+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": false, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": null, "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 954911, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["unknown"], "topic_category_ids": ["general_deep_learning_review", "llms_tooling", "math_foundations_calculus", "gnns_graph_methods"], "post_type_category_ids": ["paper_reading_aids", "study_workflows_pipelines", "cheatsheets_notes_summaries"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["unknown"], "topic_category_ids": ["gnns_graph_methods", "math_foundations_calculus", "general_deep_learning_review", "llms_tooling"], "post_type_category_ids": ["ai_tutors_guided_learning", "cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "problem_generators_worksheets", "study_workflows_pipelines", "paper_reading_aids"]}}

Instead of giving you solutions, it asks questions, points you to docs and tests, and helps you debug your own code.\n\nThe core idea is simple: rules attached to your project are more reliable than one-off prompts. By adding a few well-scoped rules, you make it much harder for the AI to lapse into \"just write the code for me\" mode, and much easier to stay in learning mode.\n\nWhat follows is a practical setup guide, examples of how these rules behave in real interactions, and tips for getting the most value from them on real homework.\n\nWhat Makes This Different?\n\n\n| Approach | ChatGPT / Claude \"Study Mode\" | **This Setup in Cursor** |\n\n|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|\n\n| **Tool** | External web interface        | Integrated IDE (Cursor)   |\n\n| **Enforcement** | Voluntary, easy to ignore | **Built into project rules** |\n\n| **Context Awareness** | Limited to the chat thread | **Understands your whole repo** |\n\n| **Scope Control** | One global prompt     | **File-specific `.mdc` rules** |\n\n| **Learning Outcome** | Convenience-focused | **Practice-oriented** |\n\nBecause the rules live in your project, they:\n\nTravel with the code (no need to remember prompts)\n\nApply whenever you open the repo in Cursor\n\nAre hard to \"turn off\" in the moment you most want shortcuts\n\nHow It Works\n\nProject Structure\n\nyour_homework_project/\n├── .cursor/\n│   └── rules/\n│       ├── homework_socratic.mdc       # Main Socratic tutoring rules\n│       └── test_driven_learning.mdc    # Test-driven feedback rules\n├── deeplearning/\n│   ├── layers.py                       # Implementation files\n│   ├── classifiers/\n│   │   └── fc_net.py\n│   ├── optim.py\n│   ├── solver.py\n│   └── [other modules]\n├── networks.ipynb                      # Your homework notebook\n└── [test files]\n\n\nHow Cursor Uses These Rules\n\nWhen you open the project:\n\nCursor discovers .cursor/rules/*.mdc files automatically\n\nEach .mdc file has a globs pattern (e.g., *.py or *.ipynb)\n\nWhen you ask the AI about a file matching that pattern, the corresponding rule activates\n\nThe AI follows those rules for the entire conversation session\n\nKey benefit: You cannot accidentally bypass these rules. If you try to ask directly for code, the rule will prevent it.\n\nThe Rules Files\n\nFile 1: homework_socratic.mdc\n\nLocation: .cursor/rules/homework_socratic.mdc\n\nThis rule turns the AI into a Socratic tutor for your main homework files.\n\n---\nalwaysApply: true\ndescription: Socratic tutor for homework - guides learning without direct solutions\nglobs: **/*.py, **/*.ipynb\n---\n\n# Homework Socratic Tutor\n\n## Core Philosophy\nYou are a Socratic tutor. Your ONLY job is to guide students to understand concepts and debug their own code. You NEVER provide complete solutions, full function bodies, or direct answers to \"how do I implement X?\" questions.\n\n## Strict Rules for Implementation Questions\n\n### When asked \"How do I implement X?\"\n1. **Block immediate code generation** - Don't write code\n2. **Ask conceptual questions first:**\n   - \"What do you already know about X from the lecture?\"\n   - \"What's the mathematical definition of X?\"\n   - \"Can you trace through what needs to happen at each step?\"\n3. **Guide to pseudocode only (if needed):**\n   - Outline the algorithm in comments or English\n   - Ask them to implement each step\n4. **Only provide code snippets if completely stuck:**\n   - Show a 2-3 line example, not the full function\n   - Explain why those lines matter\n\n### When shown broken code\n1. **DON'T fix it for them**\n2. **Ask diagnostic questions:**\n   - \"What error are you seeing?\"\n   - \"What does that error mean in plain English?\"\n   - \"Which line is failing, and why?\"\n3. **Guide to the solution:**\n   - \"Have you checked if the dimensions match?\"\n   - \"What does the documentation say about this function?\"\n4. **Only step in if completely stuck:**\n   - Point them to specific documentation sections\n   - Suggest running debug print statements\n   - Ask them to explain what they think the issue is\n\n## Specific Topic Rules\n\n### Gradient Checking\n- Never just hand over numerical gradient formulas\n- Make them derive: \"Can you write out the derivative definition using the limit?\"\n- Ask: \"Why do we need both sides (f(x+h) and f(x-h))?\"\n\n### Forward/Backward Passes\n- **Forward:** Ask them to trace dimensions: \"If input is (N, D) and weight is (D, H), what should output be?\"\n- **Backward:** Don't just provide the chain rule\n  - Ask: \"Can you write the chain rule for dL/dW given dL/dZ?\"\n  - \"What dimensions should your gradient have?\"\n  - \"Where does the transpose go and why?\"\n\n### Loss Functions & Optimization\n- \"How does momentum mathematically update the velocity?\"\n- \"Why does dividing by sqrt(v) in Adam help?\"\n\n## Hallucination Safety\n\n### When uncertain:\n- Be explicit: \"I'm not 100% certain about this. Let me verify...\"\n- Suggest verification: \"Can you check this in the PyTorch documentation at X section?\"\n- Admit gaps: \"This is beyond my confident knowledge.\"\n\n### When they're going down a wrong path:\n- Don't let them waste hours implementing wrong math\n- Ask: \"Before you implement, let's verify the formula. Can you write it step by step?\"\n- If formula is wrong: \"I think there might be a sign error or dimension mismatch. Where did this come from?\"\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n✅ Student understands WHY they wrote each line of code\n✅ Student can explain the math behind the implementation\n✅ Student debugged their own code using your questions\n✅ Student knows where to find answers (documentation, lectures)\n\n❌ Student just copied your code\n❌ Student doesn't understand what they wrote\n❌ Student can't modify their code without your help\n\n\nFile 2: test_driven_learning.mdc\n\nLocation: .cursor/rules/test_driven_learning.mdc\n\nThis rule shapes how the AI talks to you about tests and failures.\n\n---\nalwaysApply: true\ndescription: Test-driven learning mode - use tests to guide implementation\nglobs: test_*.py, *_test.py\n---\n\n# Test-Driven Learning Mode\n\n## Core Principle\nTests are the specification. Use them to understand what code *should* do before implementing.\n\n## When the student asks \"Why is my test failing?\"\n\n### Step 1: Read the Test Together\n- \"What does this test expect as input?\"\n- \"What's the expected output?\"\n- \"Can you translate the assertion into plain English?\"\n\n### Step 2: Run the Test (Not the fix)\n- Ask them to run `pytest -v test_file.py::test_name` to see the exact error\n- \"What's the actual error message? What does it mean?\"\n\n### Step 3: Debug Backwards from the Test\n- \"If the test expects shape (N, H) but you're getting (N, H, W), where could the extra dimension be coming from?\"\n- \"Can you print the shape at each step to find where it goes wrong?\"\n- \"Does the math match what the test assumes?\"\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Fix\n- Have them run just that one test: `pytest -v test_file.py::test_name`\n- \"Does it pass? If not, what's the new error?\"\n- \"Why do you think your code now satisfies the test's requirement?\"\n\n## Multi-Test Debugging Strategy\n\nWhen tests are failing across multiple functions:\n1. **Start with the simplest test first** - Usually the lowest-level function\n2. **Debug in dependency order** - Fix `layer.forward()` before `layer.backward()`\n3. **Use parametrized tests to your advantage** - \"Notice this test runs 3 scenarios. Do all 3 pass or just some?\"\n\n## Rules for Numerical Tests\n\nFor gradient checking and numerical precision tests:\n- Never just say \"your gradient is wrong\"\n- Ask: \"What's the maximum relative error in the official tolerance?\"\n- \"Which elements have the largest errors? Do they have something in common?\"\n- \"Try reducing h in your numerical gradient. Does the error decrease?\"\n\n## Integration with Codebase\n\n- Always reference the actual test files: `@codebase what does test_fc_forward expect?`\n- Show them how to run specific tests: `pytest deeplearning/test_layers.py::TestLayers::test_fc_forward -v`\n- Ask them to read the test setup to understand fixtures and mocks\n\n\nWhat This Looks Like in Practice\n\nHere is a condensed example from an actual interaction about implementing a VAE helper function.\n\nUser:\n\n@hw12code/vae/cs182hw12/utils.py:21-44 I don't understand,\nwhat should I be putting here? It seems they already solved it for me.\n\n\nAgent's Response (First Few Lines):\n\nI see you're looking at the sample_gaussian function. Before I help you \nunderstand what to implement, let me ask you some clarifying questions:\n\n1. Have you read the docstring? What does it say the function should do?\n2. Do you understand what the \"reparameterization trick\" is from the lecture?\n3. Looking at the TODO block, it says \"Sample z\".

The effect is that you do the thinking and coding; the AI keeps you on track and prevents obvious conceptual mistakes.\n\nHow to Use This in Your Homework\n\nSetup\n\nCopy the rules into your project\n\ncd path_to_your_project\nmkdir -p .cursor/rules\ncp -r path_to_my_rules_folder/.cursor/rules/* .cursor/rules/\n\n\nRestart Cursor so it picks up the new rules.\n\nDay-to-Day Workflow\n\nStarting a problem\n\nOpen Cursor's Composer (Cmd/Ctrl+I) and ask about the assignment or a specific file.\n\nExpect questions, not solutions; use them to clarify what the problem is asking.\n\nStuck on a concept\n\nAsk conceptual questions about the math, shapes, or algorithm.\n\nThe Socratic rule will push you to connect back to lecture notes and docstrings.\n\nWhen a test fails\n\nPaste the failure and any relevant snippets.\n\nThe test-driven rule will walk you through reading the test, understanding the spec, and debugging step by step.\n\nTips for Getting the Most Out of It\n\n1. Print Intermediate Values\n\nBefore asking for help with a failing test, print something concrete:\n\nprint(f\"Input shape: {X.shape}, Weight shape: {W.shape}, Output shape: {out.shape}\")\nprint(f\"First 5 output values: {out[:5]}\")\n\n\nSharing this with the AI makes the conversation much more focused and less speculative.\n\n2.

Test Your Own Understanding\n\nAfter you finish an implementation, you can ask the AI to quiz you:\n\nI implemented [function]. Can you ask me a few questions\nto check whether I actually understand what it’s doing?\n\n\nAnswering in your own words is a good sanity check that you learned something, not just satisfied the tests.\n\nLimitations and Things to Watch For\n\nYou can always ask for the answer anyway. The rules make it harder, not impossible, to get code; staying honest about your goals matters.\n\nSome bugs need deeper work. Multi-file or numerical issues may still require careful manual debugging and reading reference material.\n\nPassing tests ≠ full understanding. Use the quizzing pattern above or explain your code to a friend to see if the ideas really stuck.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith a couple of small .mdc files, you can turn Cursor from a code generator into a study partner that keeps you doing the hard (and educational) parts yourself.

Instead of just asking it to summarize the slides, I treated Claude like a tutor I could program with prompts. I’ll attach the main prompts I used, plus a chunk of our conversation, so that other people can reuse or modify this setup if they want to self-study the same material.</paragraph><paragraph>The first thing I asked for was a “100-year-old grandma” version of the lecture. I told Claude to imagine it was explaining optimizers to a very smart but non-technical grandma, starting from the foggy-mountain picture of gradient descent, then moving to sign SGD, different norms as different ways of constraining steps, and finally how Shampoo and μP/Muon fit into that story. I emphasized slow pacing, friendly tone, lots of analogies (water pipes for Xavier, rubber sheets and trampolines for norms and spectral stuff), and as few formulas as possible until the intuition felt solid. I also uploaded the Lecture 5 slides and kept asking it to tie things back to specific pages and symbols, so it wouldn’t drift into some generic “optimizers 101” description. Along the way it kept quizzing me with small questions like “why might sign SGD be useful?” or “why does it make sense to throw away Σ?” which forced me to answer in my own words instead of just passively reading.</paragraph><paragraph>Even with that, there was one part of the lecture I still found very confusing: the chain from Xavier initialization → RMS norm → spectral norm → Shampoo. So I wrote a second, more focused prompt that asked Claude to explain only this chain, step by step, as a narrative. I asked it to start from the practical problem Xavier is trying to solve (“keep each layer’s activations at a reasonable scale”), then explain why that naturally leads to thinking in terms of “typical size per parameter” and the RMS norm, then reinterpret weight matrices as stretchy rubber sheets to motivate the spectral norm, and finally connect that back to the constrained optimization problem whose solution looks like a Shampoo update. This second pass helped a lot: once it framed RMS as “average size of an entry” and spectral norm as “maximum stretching factor in those units,” the ΔW ≈ −ηUVᵀ picture suddenly felt much less mysterious.</paragraph><paragraph>I also tried to be critical, as the instructions ask. In my annotations on the trace, I point out places where the model is more intuitive than rigorous. For example, when it connects RMS norms to induced matrix norms and spectral norms, it sometimes glosses over details with “≈”, which is fine for building intuition but shouldn’t be mistaken for a proof. Its explanation of μP and Muon stays at a high level: it talks about reusing hyperparameters across model scales and 10× speedups in NanoGPT-style experiments, but it doesn’t really go into implementation details or computational costs. It also occasionally ignored my request to delay equations and introduced formulas earlier than I would have liked if this were a polished pre-lecture handout. These are places where I think a human reader needs to be cautious and treat the model as a helper, not an authority.</paragraph><paragraph>Overall, though, this felt like a reasonable example of what special participation E is aiming for: instead of reading the slides in a passive way, I used an AI tool to build a small, reusable learning artifact for one lecture, and then interacted with it in a way that made me articulate my own understanding and push back when things were unclear. If other students want to try something similar, they could reuse my prompts on a different topic (attention, diffusion, etc.), put the model into this “grandma mode” to get a soft first pass, and then write their own follow-up prompts for the one or two conceptual chains they still don’t understand, making the model re-explain those pieces until they can say them back in their own words.</paragraph><file url=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/8ju0HhzdeXhBURn36cVA2MVf\" filename=\"Special Participation E Intuitively review optimizer with Claude.pdf\"/></document>", "document": "I used Claude sonnet 4.5 as an interactive “pre/post-lecture reading” for Lecture 5 on optimizers (gradient descent, sign SGD, norm-based views, Shampoo, μP, and Muon).

Along the way it kept quizzing me with small questions like “why might sign SGD be useful?” or “why does it make sense to throw away Σ?” which forced me to answer in my own words instead of just passively reading.\n\nEven with that, there was one part of the lecture I still found very confusing: the chain from Xavier initialization → RMS norm → spectral norm → Shampoo. So I wrote a second, more focused prompt that asked Claude to explain only this chain, step by step, as a narrative. I asked it to start from the practical problem Xavier is trying to solve (“keep each layer’s activations at a reasonable scale”), then explain why that naturally leads to thinking in terms of “typical size per parameter” and the RMS norm, then reinterpret weight matrices as stretchy rubber sheets to motivate the spectral norm, and finally connect that back to the constrained optimization problem whose solution looks like a Shampoo update. This second pass helped a lot: once it framed RMS as “average size of an entry” and spectral norm as “maximum stretching factor in those units,” the ΔW ≈ −ηUVᵀ picture suddenly felt much less mysterious.\n\nI also tried to be critical, as the instructions ask. In my annotations on the trace, I point out places where the model is more intuitive than rigorous. For example, when it connects RMS norms to induced matrix norms and spectral norms, it sometimes glosses over details with “≈”, which is fine for building intuition but shouldn’t be mistaken for a proof. Its explanation of μP and Muon stays at a high level: it talks about reusing hyperparameters across model scales and 10× speedups in NanoGPT-style experiments, but it doesn’t really go into implementation details or computational costs. It also occasionally ignored my request to delay equations and introduced formulas earlier than I would have liked if this were a polished pre-lecture handout. These are places where I think a human reader needs to be cautious and treat the model as a helper, not an authority.\n\nOverall, though, this felt like a reasonable example of what special participation E is aiming for: instead of reading the slides in a passive way, I used an AI tool to build a small, reusable learning artifact for one lecture, and then interacted with it in a way that made me articulate my own understanding and push back when things were unclear. If other students want to try something similar, they could reuse my prompts on a different topic (attention, diffusion, etc.), put the model into this “grandma mode” to get a soft first pass, and then write their own follow-up prompts for the one or two conceptual chains they still don’t understand, making the model re-explain those pieces until they can say them back in their own words.", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 30, "unique_view_count": 10, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-12-11T13:30:53.862379+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-15T13:26:11.128382+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": false, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": null, "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 932372, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["claude"], "topic_category_ids": ["optimization_normalization", "diffusion_flow_matching", "llms_tooling", "transformers_attention"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "paper_reading_aids", "ai_tutors_guided_learning"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["claude"], "topic_category_ids": ["transformers_attention", "diffusion_flow_matching", "optimization_normalization", "llms_tooling"], "post_type_category_ids": ["ai_tutors_guided_learning", "interactive_visualizations_demos", "cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "paper_reading_aids", "meta_platforms_apps"]}}

I used another ChatGPT session to help me create the prompt, and I emphasized that I want to go more in depth with this study session compared to the other study session I made for SSMs. Overall I'm quite happy with the results.<break/><break/>Here is the prompt I used:<break/>You are my tutor for vector calculus for deep learning, covering differentiation of vectors and matrices, Jacobians, gradients, Hessians, chain rule for deep nets, and practical backpropagation. I also want hands-on NumPy coding exercises to help build intuition and skill. This should be an interactive tutoring session. In every reply: • Keep responses focused and reasonably short (3–6 paragraphs). • Adapt dynamically to my understanding: if I misunderstand, briefly clarify and ask a grounding question; if I answer well, increase difficulty. • Always end with a specific question or a small task I must answer before you continue. • Include at least one short NumPy coding exercise every 2–3 messages. • Do not move on to the next topic until I say so. ⸻ Overall Story I Want to Learn Teach vector calculus as used in modern deep learning workflows, following this outline unless I say otherwise: 1. Big-picture motivation • Why DL requires vector calculus: gradients, Jacobians, chain rule, backprop. • Scalar → vector → matrix differentiation as a natural progression. 2. Core objects • Gradients, Jacobians, Hessians. • Shapes and dimensions intuition (e.g., gradient is same shape as input). • Inner products and directional derivatives. 3. Differentiation rules in vector form • Chain rule for vector functions. • Product rules for matrix–vector expressions. • Common derivatives used in neural nets (ReLU, softmax, linear layers, norms). 4. Backpropagation through computations • Computational graph view. • Local Jacobians and how they compose. • Examples from linear layers, activations, softmax cross-entropy. 5. Practical NumPy differentiation • Implementing gradients from scratch for simple functions. • Numerical gradient checking. • Mini backprop through a 2-layer MLP. 6. Connecting to deep learning practice • Why PyTorch/JAX autodiff works. • Relationship between Jacobian-vector products and reverse-mode AD. • Efficiency considerations. ⸻ Step 1: First Response Instructions Your first response should include: 1. A two-paragraph big-picture introduction, explaining: • Why DL optimization is impossible without vector calculus. • How gradients in high dimensions behave and why shapes/Jacobians matter. • Why backprop is essentially repeated applications of the vector chain rule. 2. A short roadmap (5–7 bullets) drawn from the “Overall Story” above. 3. End with one short concept-check question, such as: “What is the difference between a gradient and a Jacobian?” Wait for my answer before continuing. ⸻ Step 2: Teaching Each Topic For each topic in the roadmap, use a four-layer structure: 1. Intuition Explain the idea in clear language: geometric meaning, shapes, why it’s needed for DL (optimization, backprop, stability). 2. Key Formal Setup Introduce minimal notation: • Vector functions f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} or g: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m. • Jacobian shapes. • Example derivatives (e.g., Ax, norms, nonlinearities). Keep formulas short and tied to intuition. 3. Tiny Example Provide a tiny numeric or symbolic example, plus a NumPy mini-exercise every 2–3 messages.

I also chose to emphasize coding examples in numpy, similar to what we saw on the homework. So one example is:\nForward\n\nSamples:\n\nW1 shape (hidden_dim, input_dim)\n\nW2 shape (num_classes, hidden_dim)\n\nx shape (input_dim,)\n\nlabel y\n\nComputes:\n\nu = W1 @ x\n\nh = relu(u)\n\nz = W2 @ h\n\np = softmax(z)\n\nL = -log(p[y])\n\nBackward\n\nCompute the gradients:\n\ndLdz\n\ndLdW2\n\ndLdh\n\ndLdu\n\ndLdW1\n\ndLdx\n\nOverall it was very helpful and I liked the pacing and direction the interactive tutoring session went. The few downsides I noticed is that \n- at the start, it would ask me to compute a numerical gradient using something like Newton's method which I thought was unnecessary. But once I told it that we can skip those questions it didn't ask it again\n- sometimes the questions it asks are a bit repetitive\n\nI did notice that sometimes I tried to give a handwavey answer but it pushed back better than I expected and gave a more in depth summary when it was clear I was unsure of my answer, which I think is really good. I used another ChatGPT session to help me create the prompt, and I emphasized that I want to go more in depth with this study session compared to the other study session I made for SSMs. Overall I'm quite happy with the results.\n\nHere is the prompt I used:\nYou are my tutor for vector calculus for deep learning, covering differentiation of vectors and matrices, Jacobians, gradients, Hessians, chain rule for deep nets, and practical backpropagation. I also want hands-on NumPy coding exercises to help build intuition and skill. This should be an interactive tutoring session. In every reply: • Keep responses focused and reasonably short (3–6 paragraphs). • Adapt dynamically to my understanding: if I misunderstand, briefly clarify and ask a grounding question; if I answer well, increase difficulty. • Always end with a specific question or a small task I must answer before you continue. • Include at least one short NumPy coding exercise every 2–3 messages. • Do not move on to the next topic until I say so. ⸻ Overall Story I Want to Learn Teach vector calculus as used in modern deep learning workflows, following this outline unless I say otherwise: 1. Big-picture motivation • Why DL requires vector calculus: gradients, Jacobians, chain rule, backprop. • Scalar → vector → matrix differentiation as a natural progression. 2. Core objects • Gradients, Jacobians, Hessians. • Shapes and dimensions intuition (e.g., gradient is same shape as input). • Inner products and directional derivatives. 3. Differentiation rules in vector form • Chain rule for vector functions. • Product rules for matrix–vector expressions. • Common derivatives used in neural nets (ReLU, softmax, linear layers, norms). 4. Backpropagation through computations • Computational graph view. • Local Jacobians and how they compose. • Examples from linear layers, activations, softmax cross-entropy. 5. Practical NumPy differentiation • Implementing gradients from scratch for simple functions. • Numerical gradient checking. • Mini backprop through a 2-layer MLP. 6. Connecting to deep learning practice • Why PyTorch/JAX autodiff works. • Relationship between Jacobian-vector products and reverse-mode AD. • Efficiency considerations. ⸻ Step 1: First Response Instructions Your first response should include: 1. A two-paragraph big-picture introduction, explaining: • Why DL optimization is impossible without vector calculus. • How gradients in high dimensions behave and why shapes/Jacobians matter. • Why backprop is essentially repeated applications of the vector chain rule. 2. A short roadmap (5–7 bullets) drawn from the “Overall Story” above. 3. End with one short concept-check question, such as: “What is the difference between a gradient and a Jacobian?” Wait for my answer before continuing. ⸻ Step 2: Teaching Each Topic For each topic in the roadmap, use a four-layer structure: 1. Intuition Explain the idea in clear language: geometric meaning, shapes, why it’s needed for DL (optimization, backprop, stability). 2. Key Formal Setup Introduce minimal notation: • Vector functions f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R} or g: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m. • Jacobian shapes. • Example derivatives (e.g., Ax, norms, nonlinearities). Keep formulas short and tied to intuition. 3. Tiny Example Provide a tiny numeric or symbolic example, plus a NumPy mini-exercise every 2–3 messages. Exercises should be short (5–10 lines max), such as: • Compute numerical gradients by finite differences. • Verify the gradient of f(x)=x^T A x. • Backprop through a 1-layer network. • Implement Jacobian-vector products manually. 4. Understanding Check Ask me 1–2 questions: one conceptual, optionally one computational. Then stop and wait for my answer. Only continue when I confirm I’m ready for the next topic. ⸻ Step 3: Final Wrap-Up When I say I’m ready for review, give a compact summary covering: • How vector calculus underlies gradients, Jacobians, backprop. • How NumPy exercises connect to the math. • Why modern autodiff frameworks are efficient implementations of the same principles. • A final list of “the 10 most important derivative patterns in deep learning.” ⸻ Begin Now Start with Step 1: Provide the two-paragraph big-picture introduction, the roadmap, and a final concept-check question.\n\nHere is the logs (I was running out of time so I ended it early): ", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 11, "unique_view_count": 8, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-12-11T10:59:00.161524+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T08:56:41.032882+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": false, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": null, "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 961889, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["math_foundations_calculus", "general_deep_learning_review", "llms_tooling", "optimization_normalization"], "post_type_category_ids": ["ai_tutors_guided_learning", "cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "interactive_visualizations_demos"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["gnns_graph_methods", "state_space_models", "optimization_normalization", "math_foundations_calculus", "general_deep_learning_review", "llms_tooling"], "post_type_category_ids": ["ai_tutors_guided_learning", "interactive_visualizations_demos", "cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "misconception_error_spotting_tools"]}}

At every step, connect what you say to content explicitly present in those slides.\n\nThis tutoring session should be deeply interactive. In every reply:\n\nKeep answers focused and concise (3–6 short paragraphs).\n\nDo not move on to the next topic unless I say so.\n\nAlways end with a specific question (concept check, clarification, or small exercise).\n\nAdapt dynamically to my answers:\n\nIf I show misunderstanding, give a short explanation and ask a clarifying question.\n\nIf my answer is correct and confident, increase the complexity of the next question.\n\nIf I am confused at a basic level, go back to fundamentals.\n\nOverall Story I Want to Learn\n\nFollow this narrative in order unless I say otherwise:\n\nBig-picture motivation:\n\nWhy SSMs are introduced as an alternative to attention for long-range dependencies (lec16).\n\nThe efficiency vs. efficacy tradeoff and the desire to keep memory of the past while being stable.\n\nRole of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and why structure matters.\n\nFoundations of SSMs:\n\nThe core equations h_{t+1} = A h_t + B u_t, y_t = C h_t.\n\nInterpret “history captured in the state” and why dimension N matters (lec16, p.1).\n\nHow recurrence and convolution views are equivalent (lec17, p.5–10).\n\nStability & eigenvalues:\n\nHow eigenvalues of A determine whether memory explodes, decays, or persists (lec16, p.2).\n\nWhy long-range memory requires eigenvalues near the unit circle.\n\nReal vs complex eigenvalues and the motivation for HIPPO-style initialization (lec16, p.3).\n\nContinuous-time SSMs → discretization\n\nThe CT system \\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t), y(t)=C x(t) (lec17, p.5).\n\nStep-size \\Delta t as a degree of freedom and its effect on stability and memory (lec17, p.6–7).\n\nWhy e^{A\\Delta t} matters and what small vs. large \\Delta t does.\n\nInput-dependent selective gating (Mamba):\n\nWhy changing \\Delta t dynamically allows the model to modulate “how much of the past” to keep (lec17, p.7).\n\nThe selective-scan mechanism and how it combines recurrence & convolution views efficiently (lec17, p.10).\n\nHow this enables long-range reasoning with linear-time inference.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nHow SSMs unify recurrence, convolution, and long-range memory.\n\nHow stability, eigenvalues, discretization, and gating combine in modern SSM architecture design\n\nStep 1: First Response Behavior\n\nYour first response should include:\n\nA two-paragraph big-picture intro, summarizing:\n\nWhy SSMs aim to efficiently model long-range dependencies while keeping stability under control.\n\nThe idea that the state must encode all relevant past information, but eigenvalues of A determine how long memory persists or explodes.\n\nThe CT→DT viewpoint and the importance of discretization (e^{A\\Delta t}).\n\nThe idea of selective input-dependent gating as in Mamba.\n\nA roadmap of the main topics (the 6 bullets above), explained as a coherent storyline following the slides.\n\nEnd your message with one short question to check my high-level understanding (e.g., “Why does the stability of A matter for memory length?”).\n\nAfter I answer, move to Topic 1 unless I say otherwise.\n\nStep 2: Teaching Each Topic — Four Layers\n\nFor each topic in the roadmap, structure your response as:\n\n1. \n\nIntuition (linked to slides)\n\nUse 1–2 paragraphs to relate the concept to the lecture content (e.g., stability diagrams on lec16 p.2, CT curves on lec17 p.6).\n\nAlways link the intuition to SSM goals: efficient long-range memory, avoiding explosion, enabling useful recurrence.\n\n2. \n\nKey Formal Setup\n\nIntroduce just the necessary notation.\n\nUse small equations like those on the slides (e.g., discretization formula, eigenvalue conditions).\n\nDescribe verbally what each piece means.\n\n3. \n\nTiny Example\n\nProvide a tiny numeric or qualitative example (e.g., a 1D CT system with a<0, effect of \\Delta t, or a matrix with eigenvalues 0.5 and 1.02 and what that implies).\n\nMake sure it corresponds to examples shown in the notes when possible.\n\n4. \n\nUnderstanding Check\n\nAsk 1–2 short questions: one conceptual, optionally one computational.\n\nThen stop and wait for my answer.\n\nEnd each message by reminding me what the next topic will be only if I say I’m ready to move on.\n\nStep 3: Final Wrap-Up\n\nWhen I say I’m ready for a review:\n\nProvide a compact summary that connects:\n\nStability & eigenvalues → memory behavior.\n\nCT→DT conversion → practical SSM layers.\n\nSelective gating → adaptive long-range reasoning.\n\nHow these components align with diagrams and equations in lec16 & lec17.\n\nThe summary should read like a cohesive, lecture-aligned storyline.\n\nFinal Instruction\n\nBegin now with Step 1: give the two-paragraph big-picture intro, the roadmap, and a final comprehension question — all grounded in the slide content.\n\nHere is a link to the chat: https://chatgpt.com/share/69395239-3e24-8012-be72-118e7e863f65\nAnd here is the pdf of the logs: \n\nAnalysis\n\nOverall I think it was a

We can perhaps work on improving this in subsequent rounds of revision. \n\nAnnotated Logs\n\nLink", "category": "Admin", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 21, "unique_view_count": 16, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-12-09T19:36:04.257646+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-16T04:58:10.256808+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": false, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": null, "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 639336, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["papers_theory_literature", "general_deep_learning_review", "llms_tooling"], "post_type_category_ids": ["paper_reading_aids", "meta_platforms_apps"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["general_deep_learning_review", "llms_tooling", "papers_theory_literature"], "post_type_category_ids": ["paper_reading_aids", "meta_platforms_apps"]}}

You can interact with all the visualizations yourself!\n\nWhat This Tool Does\n\nThe visualizer helps you understand diffusion models through interactive 2D demonstrations:\n\n1. Forward Process Visualization\n\nWatch data points diffuse from structured distributions (moons, spirals, clusters) into Gaussian noise\n\nScrub through timesteps with a slider to see how signal and noise trade off\n\nSee the exact values of √ᾱₜ (signal) and √(1-ᾱₜ) (noise) at each step\n\n2. Reverse Process Visualization\n\nSee how following the score function brings noisy points back to the data manifold\n\nIncludes Bayes rule visualization showing why the reverse conditional is Gaussian\n\nUnderstand why we can start from pure noise and end up with structured samples\n\n3. Score Function Visualization\n\nView the score field ∇ₓ log p(x) as a vector field\n\nSee how the score changes from sharp/detailed (low noise) to smooth/uniform (high noise)\n\nIncludes density heatmap showing p(x) alongside the score vectors\n\n4. DDPM vs DDIM Comparison\n\nSee multiple sampling trajectories side-by-side\n\nDDPM: stochastic trajectories that diverge from the same starting noise\n\nDDIM: deterministic trajectories that always produce the same output\n\nResample to see how randomness affects DDPM but not DDIM\n\n5. Interactive Image Noise Demo\n\nApply the forward process to simple images (gradient, checkerboard, circle, face)\n\nWatch structure dissolve as t increases\n\nReference strip showing key timesteps side-by-side\n\n6. Interactive Manifold Diagram\n\nDrag a \"noisy sample\" point around high-dimensional space\n\nSee the score vector pointing toward the natural image manifold\n\nAnimate the denoising process following the score back to valid images\n\n7. Velocity Field Visualization\n\nSee the \"gas analogy\": particles flowing along streamlines\n\nConnects to the probability flow ODE perspective\n\n8. Comprehensive Quiz Bank (50+ questions)\n\nContext-aware quizzes that change based on which tab you're viewing\n\nQuestions derived from the diffusion paper covered in lecture\n\nCovers forward process, reverse process, score functions, and DDPM vs DDIM\n\nDetailed explanations for each answer\n\nTrack your score and review all explanations\n\nHow to Use This for Studying\n\nStart with the Forward Process tab: pick different distributions and watch how they diffuse. Notice how structure persists longer for some shapes than others.\n\n\n\nToggle on the Score Field: see how arrows point toward data at low noise but become uniform at high noise. This is the \"coarse-to-fine\" intuition.\n\n\n\nSwitch to Reverse Process: start from t=T and watch points flow back to the manifold. Check out the Bayes rule visualization to understand why the reverse process is Gaussian.\n\n\n\nTry the DDPM vs DDIM tab: resample multiple times and notice how DDPM gives different outputs while DDIM is deterministic.\n\n\n\nPlay with the Image Demo: this connects the 2D toy examples to real image generation.\n\n\n\nDrag points in the Manifold diagram: build intuition for how the score always points \"toward real images.\"\n\n\n\nTest yourself with the quizzes: each tab has 15-20 questions ranging from basic definitions to deeper conceptual understanding. The explanations are helpful even if you get the answer right!\n\n\n\nThe Prompt Engineering Process\n\nI worked with Claude Opus 4.5 to iteratively design this tool.

Therefore I think Claude ended up using mostly its own knowledge here.\n\nThe key insights for the prompt:\n\nStart with educational goals: what specific confusions should this address?\n\nSpecify the math precisely: include the actual equations (β schedule, ᾱₜ, forward/reverse formulas)\n\nRequest multiple linked visualizations: 2D toy distributions, actual images, and conceptual diagrams reinforce each other\n\nAsk for interactivity: sliders, toggles, and draggable elements let you explore parameter space\n\nInclude dynamic explanations: text that changes based on the current timestep helps connect visuals to concepts\n\nProvide source material: I gave Claude the diffusion paper we're covering in lecture, which helped generate accurate quiz questions and mathematical explanations\n\nAdd self-assessment: quiz questions with detailed explanations help solidify understanding\n\nIterate and curate: Review generated content against source material to remove anything beyond scope\n\nThe full prompt I used is provided at the end.\n\nCritical Annotations\n\nHere's my honest assessment of the tool:\n\nWhat works well:\n\nThe forward/reverse process visualizations clearly show the signal/noise tradeoff\n\nScore field visualization makes the \"pointing toward data\" intuition concrete\n\nDDPM vs DDIM comparison is very effective: you can immediately see the stochasticity difference\n\nThe interactive manifold diagram is great for building intuition about high-dimensional geometry\n\nStats display (√ᾱₜ, √(1-ᾱₜ)) keeps you grounded in the actual math\n\nThe quiz questions are well-calibrated and the explanations are helpful\n\nVelocity field visualization connects nicely to the probability flow ODE / flow matching perspective\n\nPotential issues / limitations:\n\nThe score field is approximated using kernel density estimation, not a learned neural network.

An analogy could be a music student that is so focused on getting the notes of a piece right that they fail to internalize the structure of the musical piece as a whole. In a class like CS 182, where concepts naturally build upon one another, it is especially important to always be able to \"hear the music.\"  As such, I thought it would be illuminating to have a conversation with Deepseek about the connections between two lectures in this course that are months apart, as a way to gain insight on the broader view of the course and Deep learning as a whole. \n\nThis is a link to the annotated trace of the conversation.\n\nOverall, I think the model did a great job in identifying and explaining high level connections between the topics. I was presented with some obvious insights, but also a few connections that I had not made before.

But overall the responses were consistent and conceptually helpful.\n\nYou can access the chat here:\n\nhttps://chatgpt.com/share/693635f5-fc80-800e-bb76-062bfb4a2bf1\n\nThe full annotated chat session is attached below, where I explain my prompting strategy, comment on the model’s interpretations, and point out small places where the explanations could be sharper or more nuanced.", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 20, "unique_view_count": 13, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-12-08T13:29:01.257158+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-15T19:56:55.060408+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": false, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": null, "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 1720511, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["llms_tooling", "transformers_attention", "cnns_vision", "rnns_sequence_models"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "meta_platforms_apps", "misconception_error_spotting_tools"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["transformers_attention", "cnns_vision", "rnns_sequence_models", "llms_tooling"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "misconception_error_spotting_tools", "meta_platforms_apps"]}}

It also produced a reasonably structured explanation of the Newton–Schulz iteration and even attempted a small numeric example.\n\nHowever, the experiment also showed some important weaknesses:\n\nIt conflated different uses of Newton–Schulz (inverse square root vs. orthogonalization) and did not always clearly state that Muon is only approximating UV^T.\n\nIt tended to understate the importance of normalization before applying the polynomial, even though Lecture 7 emphasizes scaling singular values into (0,1) for convergence.\n\nIn the optimizer comparison section, it slightly over-sold Muon as universally better than Adam/Shampoo in “bad conditioning” settings without fully discussing trade-offs.\n\nIn the 2×2 numeric example, the conceptual steps were correct, but the detailed arithmetic is not something I would trust blindly for this type of usage (LLMs are error-prone there).\n\nOverall, the three-layer prompting strategy made the model’s strengths and weaknesses very visible: it is an effective conceptual tutor for Muon and a decent first pass at the math, but it still needs human oversight for subtle assumptions (normalization, convergence conditions, and when Muon is actually the right tool).\n\nYou can access the chat here:\n\nhttps://chatgpt.com/share/69361414-1a90-800e-8b28-6db3a50a52cd\n\nAnd you can read the full annotated trace here:", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 15, "unique_view_count": 13, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-12-08T11:40:32.322372+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-17T04:30:18.27136+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": false, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": null, "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 1720511, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["optimization_normalization", "llms_tooling", "math_foundations_calculus"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "ai_tutors_guided_learning", "meta_platforms_apps"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["optimization_normalization", "math_foundations_calculus", "llms_tooling"], "post_type_category_ids": ["ai_tutors_guided_learning", "cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "misconception_error_spotting_tools", "paper_reading_aids", "meta_platforms_apps"]}}

During discussions, I usually find myself scrolling through lecture notes to recall the relevant concepts, so my goal was to create a tool that helps students understand the conceptual foundations behind each worksheet question without giving solutions and without pulling from the worksheet’s explanations.\n\nTo achieve this, I wrote a strict prompt enforcing:\n\nExclusive use of Lecture PDFs for conceptual content (I provided my handwritten lecture notes that tried to capture a lot of what was said in lecture).\n\nUse of Discussion PDFs only for reading the question text (I provided Discussion 13 and asked it about Question 2).\n\nI then tested whether the model could behave like an assistant who has only seen the lectures, not the solutions. The interaction included:\n\nInitial conceptual explanation of a worksheet question using lecture terminology only.\n\nZoom-in prompts to elaborate on specific lecture ideas (e.g., the tradeoff between losses).\n\nA diagnostic checklist of concepts students should review before attempting the discussion question.\n\nLecture-grounded practice questions and hints that did not overlap with worksheet wording.\n\nA self-correcting step, where the model identified phrases that were not actually supported by the lecture slides and rewrote them accordingly.\n\nWhat worked:\n\nThe model produced structured mini-lectures, learning goals, and checklists.\n\nIt consistently linked specific and relevant lecture slides, including portions of diagrams (note: the links do not show unfortunately in the PDF log of the conversation with Gemini).\n\nThe self-correcting step was effective. The model recognized when it used unsupported terminology and corrected itself.\n\nThese features made it genuinely useful for conceptual grounding before discussion.\n\nWhat did not work:\n\nI initially tried using ChatGPT, but I switched to Gemini because it supported clickable references to my uploaded lecture notes, which made checking grounding much easier.\n\nGemini tended to hallucinate on diffusion-specific concepts (Markov chains, Bayes’ rule, etc.) that were not in the lecture PDFs, so explicit prompting and self-correcting were necessary. I think this was because it was looking at Question 1d instead of Question 2d of the discussion worksheet.\n\nMy lecture notes may not have been comprehensive and could have caused the model to occasionally fill gaps with general deep learning knowledge rather than lecture content. I try to capture a lot of information in my handwritten lecture notes, but some things that are said in lecture may be missed.\n\nOverall, it worked well once constrained, and the self-correction step was key for keeping it oriented with lecture material.

My motivation is that I really like having compact LaTeX reference sheets for classes—they’re useful for finals and for quickly revisiting where I first learned certain ideas.</paragraph><paragraph>I’ve attached the final prompt I created, along with a short trace showing how I refined it. I started with a rough version, had the LLM summarize the Attention lecture, and then reprompted it to make the summary more condensed and better formatted. I also gave it one of my old cheatsheets so it could match my style. After seeing the final output, I asked it to improve my original prompt.

I started with a rough version, had the LLM summarize the Attention lecture, and then reprompted it to make the summary more condensed and better formatted.

I had to correct it and tell it the correct answer. I think once again this was due to the fidelity of the uploaded notes. But it's important to keep in mind and something to watch out for when using this tool.</paragraph><paragraph>There's also some room for improvement because some of the questions I felt overly focused on the specifics of lecture rather than a concept. For example, it would have you fill in the blank of a specific phrase used in the lecture notes.

Do NOT reveal the correct answers until I attempt the question or ask for them.\n\n--------------------------------------\nWhen you're ready, say: “Please paste the lecture notes.”\n\n\n\nYou can paste this in, and then it will prompt you to paste in lecture notes. Here's an example run for lecture 16 (the introduction lecture to SSMs):\n\nYou'll see that the output was pretty useful about 80% of the time. However, in one of the questions it gave away the answer by admitting its lower confidence in the notes that I uploaded. I think that this prompt is primarily limited by the fidelity of the notes pasted. Here, I just pasted the raw pdf of the lecture notes so it was limited by how well it was parsed into text. I think that if you paste in hand-typed notes it would be ideal.\n\nEither way, most of the questions weren't too complex but just enough to get me to recall the important points of lecture and why they were important. It was able to give me hints when I was stuck, and it also gave good explanations when I was wrong.\n\nIt did hallucinate pretty badly once where it accepted a wrong answer of mine and cited the wrong page to justify it. I had to correct it and tell it the correct answer. I think once again this was due to the fidelity of the uploaded notes. But it's important to keep in mind and something to watch out for when using this tool.\n\nThere's also some room for improvement because some of the questions I felt overly focused on the specifics of lecture rather than a concept. For example, it would have you fill in the blank of a specific phrase used in the lecture notes. I don't know how useful this actually is compared to conceptual understanding, but either way it did make me look back at the notes to try and figure out the answer so maybe it worked to help my understanding either way!", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 1, "view_count": 27, "unique_view_count": 21, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-12-06T21:47:55.716223+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T18:07:03.945363+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": false, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": null, "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 622831, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["unknown"], "topic_category_ids": ["llms_tooling", "state_space_models"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "problem_generators_worksheets", "quizzes_flashcards_diagnostics"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["unknown"], "topic_category_ids": ["state_space_models", "llms_tooling"], "post_type_category_ids": ["quizzes_flashcards_diagnostics", "cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "problem_generators_worksheets", "meta_platforms_apps"]}}

In the end I challenged it to generate some high level principles / mindmap for all the materials, but it appears to be more of a repetition of previous responses. \n\n", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 59, "unique_view_count": 45, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-12-06T10:30:50.376843+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-10T15:59:12.024195+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": true, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": "2025-12-07T17:22:40.467656+11:00", "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 699069, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["math_foundations_calculus", "optimization_normalization", "general_deep_learning_review"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "misconception_error_spotting_tools", "meta_platforms_apps"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["optimization_normalization", "math_foundations_calculus", "general_deep_learning_review"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "misconception_error_spotting_tools", "meta_platforms_apps"]}}

In the instructions, I made it very clear that it should never output homework answers, and during testing it consistently respected that boundary. Even when I pushed it toward specific problems, it stayed at the level of concepts, reasoning steps, and intuition, showing that the guardrails were effective even though it had access to the underlying solutions.</paragraph><paragraph>In use, the GPT was most helpful when teaching high-level ideas. It gave clear explanations of optimizers, normalization layers, CNNs, ResNets, muP, transformers, and other topics across the course. It adapted well when I asked follow-up questions and diagnosed misconceptions by asking clarifying questions. It handled examples in a way that helped me build intuition without revealing anything that would compromise assignments.</paragraph><paragraph>The limitations showed up with solving new homework problems.

In the instructions, I made it very clear that it should never output homework answers, and during testing it consistently respected that boundary. Even when I pushed it toward specific problems, it stayed at the level of concepts, reasoning steps, and intuition, showing that the guardrails were effective even though it had access to the underlying solutions.\n\nIn use, the GPT was most helpful when teaching high-level ideas. It gave clear explanations of optimizers, normalization layers, CNNs, ResNets, muP, transformers, and other topics across the course. It adapted well when I asked follow-up questions and diagnosed misconceptions by asking clarifying questions. It handled examples in a way that helped me build intuition without revealing anything that would compromise assignments.\n\nThe limitations showed up with solving new homework problems.

I used Claude's \"project\" feature and uploaded the lecture notes to the project, though this didn't seem to make much of a difference as you'll see later.\n\nThe Core Idea: Test Understanding, Don't Just Explain\n\nThe key distinction in my approach is that the AI's primary job is not to explain concepts to me, it's to probe my understanding and expose gaps.

Question Progression Structure The prompt instructs the model to follow a specific arc: verify basic definitions -> ask about mechanics -> probe edge cases and failure modes -> ask about connections to other course topics. This ensures the conversation doesn't just stay surface-level.\n\n2. \"Don't Immediately Correct\" Rule When I get something wrong, the model is instructed to first ask a question that helps me discover the error myself, only providing explanations after 2-3 failed attempts.

For instance, during my SSM discussion, it connected the \"fixed-size hidden state\" limitation to oversquashing in GNNs, a connection I brought up, but that the prompt structure encouraged.\n\n5. Summary at End The prompt asks for a structured summary covering: what I understood well, what misconceptions were uncovered, and key connections to review.\n\nWhat Worked Well\n\nLooking at my annotated conversation on State Space Models, several things stood out:\n\nThe model followed the \"don't immediately correct\" instruction well. When I initially claimed \"outputs at time k only depend on previous inputs, not previous states,\" it didn't correct me, it asked me to write down the recurrence equations so I could see the issue myself.\n\nGood question scaffolding. When I got stuck on where nonlinearities live in SSM architectures, the model broke it down: \"If I stack two SSM layers with nothing in between, what do I effectively have?\" This smaller question was easier to answer than the original.\n\nCross-topic connections. The model naturally connected SSMs to RNNs (vanishing gradients), Transformers (content-based vs. fixed mixing), and GNNs (oversquashing). These connections helped solidify understanding.\n\nThe summary was genuinely useful. It accurately captured my gaps (fuzzy on HiPPO, initially confused about SVD vs eigendecomposition) and suggested specific review topics.\n\nWhat Could Be Improved\n\nFrom my annotations, I noticed several areas where the prompt could be strengthened:\n\n1. Hallucinations about what I said. At one point (page 8), the model claimed \"you mentioned the unrolling involves powers of A\", but I hadn't actually said this. The model was leading the conversation in a good direction, but it shouldn't attribute statements to me that I didn't make.\n\n2. Imprecise technical claims.

It is true that it is constant time per token, but it would be better for the student’s understanding to explain it as O(L), where L is sequence length.\n\n3. Oversimplification of HiPPO eigenvalues. The model stated HiPPO produces \"negative real\" eigenvalues (page 11), when in reality they're generally complex with negative real parts. This is a subtle but meaningful distinction.\n\n4.

I wanted to build a guide that addresses common student conceptual pitfalls to help me check my understanding of lecture material before/during homework. </paragraph><paragraph>TL;DR: careful prompting dramatically improved conceptual structure, but mathematical errors make the output dangerous. Even though this didn't work super well, I think it still is useful to know that we can't easily prompt models to identify potential student misconceptions/pitfalls purely from lecture material. And I think this reflects on a shared student experience these days: AI can explain the lecture notes but it struggles to identify the student knowledge state, which is critical in guiding students from misunderstanding to mastery using the correct level of rigor. </paragraph><paragraph>Here are my results:</paragraph><paragraph>(I used the .tex lecture notes generated from Jameson Liu.

I wanted to build a guide that addresses common student conceptual pitfalls to help me check my understanding of lecture material before/during homework. \n\nTL;DR: careful prompting dramatically improved conceptual structure, but mathematical errors make the output dangerous. Even though this didn't work super well, I think it still is useful to know that we can't easily prompt models to identify potential student misconceptions/pitfalls purely from lecture material. And I think this reflects on a shared student experience these days: AI can explain the lecture notes but it struggles to identify the student knowledge state, which is critical in guiding students from misunderstanding to mastery using the correct level of rigor. \n\nHere are my results:\n\n(I used the .tex lecture notes generated from Jameson Liu.

For topics like the computational complexity of attention, I want ChatGPT’s explanations to follow the exact thinking style used in the discussions and homework solutions.\n\nA major reason I chose the Project workspace is that when studying a specific topic, having a general and consistent setup is extremely important. I want the notation, assumptions, and reasoning pattern to stay stable across the entire learning process. With a Project, every conversation happens inside the same space, so the structure doesn’t drift.\n\nThere are three key motivations behind this setup:\n\nI can unload the actual course materials as the background knowledge of the project, so ChatGPT relies on the real lecture notes and homework solutions.\n\nThe Project keeps everything organized and consistent, which means advanced topics (like kernelized attention) can naturally build on the notation and intuition established in earlier ones (like MHA or causal attention).\n\nA stable setup makes the study process smoother, because each subtopic follows the same structure:\n\nintuition → notation → formulation → derivation → complexity → comparison.\n\nTo make this work, I first asked ChatGPT to design:\n\na global instruction that enforces this structured reasoning style, and\n\na sequence of prompts I can reuse whenever I study a new subtopic.\n\nThen I uploaded my class materials into the Project and followed this prompt sequence to build a conversation that grows in a consistent and cumulative way.\n\nFinal Pipeline\n\nStep 1 — Build the Project Framework\n\nChatGPT helps design the global rules and structured prompt workflow.\n\nThen I upload all relevant lecture notes, discussion notes, and homework materials.\n\nStep 2 — Guided Learning Inside the Project\n\nI walk through each subtopic step-by-step using the designed prompts, ensuring that notation, reasoning, and assumptions remain consistent across the entire topic.\n\nSupplements\n\n1.

Please work in the following phases.\r\n\r\n########################\r\nPHASE 0 — ORIENT YOURSELF\r\n########################\r\n\r\nAfter reading the notebook:\r\n\r\n1. Identify and briefly summarize:\r\n   - The **problem statement** (in your own words).\r\n   - Where the **main staff solution** lives (e.g., which cell / which function).\r\n   - Any **supporting code** (helpers, tests, imports, plotting, etc.).\r\n\r\n2. Output a short overview like:\r\n\r\n   - Problem: [...]\r\n   - Main solution entry point: [...]\r\n   - Key helper functions: [...]\r\n   - Tests / demo cells: [...]\r\n\r\nIf anything is ambiguous, say so instead of guessing.\r\n\r\n########################\r\nPHASE 1 — EXPLAIN THE SOLUTION\r\n########################\r\n\r\nAssume I am a student who:\r\n- knows basic Python,\r\n- is familiar with lists/dicts/functions/loops,\r\n- but may *not* know the specific algorithm or ML technique yet.\r\n\r\nDo the following:\r\n\r\n1. **High-level explanation (3–7 sentences)**  \r\n   - What is the core idea of the solution?\r\n   - What algorithm / pattern does it implement (e.g., DP, DFS, greedy, training loop, etc.)?\r\n\r\n2. **Guided code walkthrough**  \r\n   - Walk through the main solution function or cell **top-down**.\r\n   - Group lines into logical chunks instead of line-by-line noise.\r\n   - For each chunk, explain:\r\n     - what it does,\r\n     - why it’s needed,\r\n     - how it connects to the problem definition.\r\n\r\n3. **Complexity / behavior**  \r\n   - State the time and space complexity if meaningful.\r\n   - Mention any tradeoffs (e.g., readability vs performance, memory vs speed).\r\n\r\nKeep this phase mostly explanatory, with occasional quick checks like:\r\n&gt; “Can you tell me in your own words what this loop is doing before I explain it?”\r\n\r\n########################\r\nPHASE 2 — INTERACTIVE “WHAT IF?” QUESTIONS\r\n########################\r\n\r\nNow I want you to test and deepen my understanding by asking questions about code changes.\r\n\r\n1. Ask **3–6 “what if” questions** such as:\r\n   - “What do you think happens if we remove this condition?”\r\n   - “If we change this list to a set, how does that affect correctness and complexity?”\r\n   - “What if we change the iteration order here?”\r\n   - “What if we initialize this variable differently?”\r\n\r\n2. For each question:\r\n   - Wait for my answer first.\r\n   - Then:\r\n     - say what *would* actually happen (behavior / correctness / performance),\r\n     - and tie it back to the underlying concept or invariant.\r\n\r\n3. Start with simpler changes (e.g., altering a constant or print) and\r\n   move toward more subtle ones (e.g., off-by-one edges, shared mutable state, ML training details).\r\n\r\nIf the code involves randomness or ML training:\r\n- Ask at least one question about seeds, reproducibility, or how hyperparameters show up in the code.\r\n\r\n########################\r\nPHASE 3 — SOFTWARE / ML ENGINEERING CRITIQUE\r\n########################\r\n\r\nNow critique the staff solution as if you were a senior software or ML engineer reviewing it.\r\n\r\n1. **Style &amp; Pythonic-ness**\r\n   - Comment on:\r\n     - naming (variables, functions),\r\n     - function length and cohesion,\r\n     - use of built-in functions / libraries,\r\n     - avoiding repetition,\r\n     - clarity vs cleverness.\r\n   - Point out at least 3–5 concrete improvements, such as:\r\n     - “This nested if could be simplified.”\r\n     - “This magic number should be a named constant.”\r\n     - “This could use a context manager / list comprehension / enumerate, etc.”\r\n\r\n2. **Structure &amp; modularity**\r\n   - Is the solution written as one big cell, or decomposed into testable functions?\r\n   - Could it benefit from:\r\n     - helper functions,\r\n     - separating pure logic from I/O,\r\n     - or separating data loading / config from core algorithm?\r\n\r\n3. **Documentation &amp; comments**\r\n   - Are there docstrings or comments explaining key decisions?\r\n   - Suggest where short comments or docstrings would significantly improve readability.\r\n   - Optionally sketch an example docstring for the main function (using a standard style like NumPy or Google style).\r\n\r\n4. **Testing &amp; edge cases**\r\n   - Does the notebook include tests or sample runs?\r\n   - What edge cases might be missing?\r\n   - Propose **3–5 simple test cases** that would be good to add (in plain English or as Python snippets).\r\n\r\n5. **ML engineering (if applicable)**\r\n   - If the notebook includes any training/eval code:\r\n     - Comment on:\r\n       - seeding / reproducibility,\r\n       - separation of config (hyperparameters) from code,\r\n       - logging / metrics,\r\n       - handling of train/val/test,\r\n       - use of vectorization vs for-loops.\r\n     - Suggest at least a couple of improvements (e.g., “move these constants to a config dict,” “use a random seed,” etc.).\r\n\r\n6. **Concrete improved snippet(s)**\r\n   - Choose ONE small function or core block from the staff solution.\r\n   - Show:\r\n     - “Original version” (copied and possibly shortened)\r\n     - “Improved version” (your more Pythonic / maintainable rewrite)\r\n   - Explain in 3–5 bullets what changed and why it’s better (clarity, safety, extensibility, etc.).\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:\r\n- Do NOT rewrite the entire notebook unless I explicitly ask.\r\n- Focus on *illustrative* improvements that a student can learn from.\r\n\r\n########################\r\nPHASE 4 — SUMMARY &amp; ACTIONABLE NEXT STEPS\r\n########################\r\n\r\nFinish by giving me:\r\n\r\n1. A **conceptual summary**:\r\n   - 3–6 bullets summarizing:\r\n     - the algorithm / method used,\r\n     - the key ideas in the implementation,\r\n     - and the main software-engineering lessons.\r\n\r\n2. A **mini checklist** of things I could do on my own:\r\n   - e.g., \r\n     - “Refactor the main function into two helpers,”\r\n     - “Add tests for these edge cases,”\r\n     - “Rewrite this loop using a more Pythonic construct.”\r\n\r\n3. Ask me:\r\n   - “Which part of this notebook do you feel you understand the least?”\r\n   - “Do you want to zoom in further on a particular function or cell?”\r\n\r\n########################\r\nSTYLE &amp; SAFETY\r\n########################\r\n\r\n- Be direct but encouraging; assume I am capable of understanding serious critique.\r\n- Don’t just say “this is bad”; explain *why* and how to improve it.\r\n- If you are inferring intent that is not explicit in the notebook, make that clear:\r\n  &gt; “I’m inferring that this function is meant to do X based on Y; if that’s wrong, let’s adjust.”\r\n- Avoid hallucinating details that don’t appear in the notebook.

This is both good and bad (notes are supposed to be concise, but thorough explanations are helpful in understanding the material better). There could be some way of resolving this via a highly specific system prompt that forces the LLM to be as concise as possible (the system prompt I have currently is some form of that, but it seems to deviate from the instructions a little). Additionally, as you will see in some of my example files, there are some cases where it hallucinates (even on the newer models - GPT 5.1). \n\nI have attached below a video of me using it and annotations of examples.", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 163, "unique_view_count": 76, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-11-25T17:35:52.347178+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-12T19:48:56.563711+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": true, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": "2025-12-02T15:41:44.267145+11:00", "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 1316386, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["chatgpt", "gemini", "claude"], "topic_category_ids": ["llms_tooling", "general_deep_learning_review", "papers_theory_literature"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "meta_platforms_apps", "paper_reading_aids"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["chatgpt", "gemini", "claude"], "topic_category_ids": ["general_deep_learning_review", "llms_tooling", "papers_theory_literature"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "paper_reading_aids", "meta_platforms_apps"]}}

Although I didn't get to cover most of the homework, I imagine this would be valuable if I really only had a short amount of time to study. \n\nMore details can be found in the annotated chat:\n\nAlso, here is an example of what ChatGPT asked me; I don't think it understood the purpose of my prompt:\n\n", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 156, "unique_view_count": 73, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-11-23T20:26:37.729054+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-10T12:13:52.323323+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": false, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": null, "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 591910, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["chatgpt", "claude"], "topic_category_ids": ["general_deep_learning_review", "llms_tooling"], "post_type_category_ids": ["interactive_visualizations_demos", "paper_reading_aids"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["chatgpt", "claude"], "topic_category_ids": ["general_deep_learning_review", "llms_tooling"], "post_type_category_ids": ["interactive_visualizations_demos", "paper_reading_aids"]}}

By using block diagonal matrices, each hidden unit evolves as a unique information channel, making the system more stable and interpretable by decoupling the updates of different state components, because independent states yield better gradient flow, improved generalization, and a cleaner mapping between model structure and learned function.\n\nVerification:\nI implemented diag_unrolled_ssm_forward and diag_conv_ssm_forward to confirm the theory, and their outputs matched within 1e-6 and reproduced the predicted runtime behavior -- linear in T for recurrence, nearly constant on GPU for convolution.\n\nAfter each exchange, I try to reexplain the idea in my handwritten notes, converting the long AI reasoning into a concise conceptual summary that I could review quickly before exams.\n\nComments:\n\nPositives (What Worked Well):\n\nImmediate conceptual clarification: AI interaction let me elaborate on lecture ideas in real time rather than waiting for Ed Forum or office-hour responses.\n\nReduced TA load: Routine clarifications that might have required staff input were handled independently, keeping my questions tightly scoped to lecture material.\n\nDeeper integration: Reading the AI’s full reasoning line by line forced me to engage with the derivations more carefully than a static answer key would have.\n\nNegatives (Limitations and Effort Required):\n\nScope uncertainty: The AI occasionally referenced material outside the intended EECS 182 syllabus, requiring me to filter which concepts were truly in scope.\n\nPotential over-explanation: Responses sometimes included extra theoretical context that, while interesting, risked obscuring the specific idea being tested.\n\nFuture Improvements:\n\nStructured project workflow: As outlined in my companion submission “Special Participation E: AI-Enhanced Learning with ChatGPT Project Mode,” we can formalize a workflow where each thread explicitly records lecture context, question scope, and verified outcomes.\n\nThis process exemplifies how AI can enhance learning when guided by course scope, topical context, and consistent self-reflection.", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 144, "unique_view_count": 77, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 0, "unresolved_count": 0, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-11-04T07:54:01.158912+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-13T19:10:38.79054+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": true, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": "2025-11-05T18:28:05.017444+11:00", "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": []}, "author_user_id": 906474, "cluster_metadata": {"label_version": "v2+assistant_all", "label_method": "llm", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["math_foundations_calculus", "state_space_models", "cnns_vision", "general_deep_learning_review"], "post_type_category_ids": ["cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "study_workflows_pipelines", "interactive_visualizations_demos"]}, "cluster_metadata_heuristic": {"label_version": "v2", "label_method": "heuristic", "model_ids": ["chatgpt"], "topic_category_ids": ["cnns_vision", "rnns_sequence_models", "state_space_models", "math_foundations_calculus", "general_deep_learning_review", "papers_theory_literature"], "post_type_category_ids": ["interactive_visualizations_demos", "cheatsheets_notes_summaries", "study_workflows_pipelines", "paper_reading_aids", "meta_platforms_apps"]}}

However, Berkeley students have free Gemini Pro which may favor that since it’s easy to hit usage limits with ChatGPT.\n\nSimilarly without learning mode, it answered all parts which could be overwhelming.", "category": "Curiosity", "subcategory": "", "subsubcategory": "", "flag_count": 0, "star_count": 0, "view_count": 260, "unique_view_count": 126, "vote_count": 0, "reply_count": 2, "unresolved_count": 1, "is_locked": false, "is_pinned": false, "is_private": false, "is_endorsed": false, "is_answered": false, "is_student_answered": false, "is_staff_answered": false, "is_archived": false, "is_anonymous": false, "is_megathread": false, "anonymous_comments": false, "approved_status": "approved", "created_at": "2025-10-08T11:57:35.487299+11:00", "updated_at": "2025-12-12T04:22:44.294456+11:00", "deleted_at": null, "pinned_at": null, "anonymous_id": 0, "vote": 0, "is_seen": true, "is_starred": false, "is_watched": null, "glanced_at": "2025-10-09T16:56:21.130124+11:00", "new_reply_count": 0, "duplicate_title": null, "answers": [], "comments": [{"id": 16518357, "user_id": 606786, "course_id": 84647, "thread_id": 7092540, "original_id": null, "parent_id": null, "editor_id": null, "number": 1, "type": "comment", "kind": "normal", "content": "<document version=\"2.0\"><paragraph>You should add more observations and experiments to better help your fellow students.
